Supplementary materials for "AMP Chain Graphs: Minimal Separators and Structure Learning Algorithms" 

Generated data for randomly generated Gaussian chain graph models with 50 variables and N = 2 (expected number of adjacent vertices)
can be found at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/zdyitxo24ud0j0p/GeneratedData_AMPCGs_50nodes_AverageDegree2.rar?dl=0

The adjacency matrices for original AMP CGs and corresponding largest deflagged graphs can be found at "DATA_AMPCGs_Experiments.zip".
